## About

Hi there, Welcome. I want to thank you for taking the time to make it here out of the billion other sites you could have visited. I graduated from University of California, Santa Cruz in 2017. While in school I took <a href="img/about/sailing.jpg">sailing</a> classes, went on countless <a href="img/about/hikes.jpg"> hikes</a> all over the northern california coast and made some lifetime <a href="img/about/school.jpg">friends</a> getting my bachelor of science degree in Computer Science. Now I am living my best <a href="img/about/friends_la.jpg">life</a> in Los Angeles County, CA while also diving deeper into my love for coding, deep space, and anything else that pushes me to be the best version of myself. While you are here donâ€™t hesitate to email me. Happy to have you here.

-Leah
