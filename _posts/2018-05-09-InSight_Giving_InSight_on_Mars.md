I was one of the lucky few that got to see the first interplanetary launch to take off from the west coast! It all started when I rolled out of bed at 3:30 AM PST on May 5th. When I first got to the street Esplanade with my dog Charlie, it was dead silent. I was the first to arrive. I waited another 15 minutes for the live webcast to start and too my excitement the launch was still on. Charlie (my Cocker Spaniel) and I sat at a bench as spectators started to arrive to watch one of the coolest launches that has taken place at Vandenberg Air Force Base.

As the time went on more and more cars were showing up and more and more people were getting ready to watch the show. I was in the edge of the bench waiting for the clock to strike 4:05 AM and for the webcast to say all systems ready. As soon as it did I jumped up to my feet and stared across the ocean and watched the ULA Atlas V Rocket blast off, the first step to getting InSight to Mars.

I am excited for November 26th, 2018 when InSight will finally reach its home. Did you see the launch too? Want to chat about it? Feel free to email me at <leahlang4d@gmail.com>. Canâ€™t wait to hear from you!


Check out a video off my Instagram Story that I caught that morning:
