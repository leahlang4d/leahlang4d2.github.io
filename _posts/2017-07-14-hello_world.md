Hi there and welcome to my new beginning. I am a recent college graduate who is looking
to make a significant impact on this world. I don't know what this impact will 
be yet, but I am hoping to figure out soon. The past four years of my life I have
been a rollercoaster. I have accomplished so much but yet I feel like I have little to 
nothing to show of my accomplishments (maybe it's because my degree hasn't came in the mail yet). This could be the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome"> imposter syndrome </a>
but I feel like you have to have more accomplishments in order to have the imposter syndrome, maybe
its just insecurity. Well whatever it could be I am going to work on shaking this awful feeling
by expanding my knowledge and limiting wasting time thinking about thinks that don't matter. I hope
this blog won't bore you to death if it does you can send me an email about how I wasted you time. It could help 
improve my other post. Have a great day!
